          On August 12, 2013, Musk unveiled a concept for a high-speed transportation system ( Hyperloop) incorporating reduced-pressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air compressors. The mechanism for releasing the concept was an alpha-design document that, in addition to scoping out the technology, outlined a notional route where such a transport system might be built: between the Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area.

          In December 2015, Musk announced the creation of OpenAI, a

          aims to develop artificial general intelligence in a way that is safe
          and beneficial to humanity. By making AI available to everyone, OpenAI
          wants to "counteract large corporations who may gain too much power by
          owning super-intelligence systems devoted to profits, as well as
          governments which may use AI to gain power and even oppress their
          citizenry".

          In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup company,
          to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence. The
          company, which is still in the earliest stages of existence, is
          centered on creating devices that can be implanted in the human brain,
          with the eventual purpose of helping human beings merge with software
          and keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence. These
          enhancements could improve memory or allow for more direct interfacing
          with computing devices.
